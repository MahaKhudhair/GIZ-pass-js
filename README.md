### Full-stack web development - JS pass task solution
- I solve JS pass task to be accepted in Full-Stack Development Bootcamp from Computiq.
- I fixed the problem in the code so it is working as a bubble sort algorithm, that is used for sorting integers number of the given array in ASC order then again in DESC order.
- I made The “numbers” array in the code immutable by using var instead of let.
- Then I let the numbers list read from data.txt file, sort it in ASC order, then store it in a new file called output.txt
- I hope I have solved it right :)
